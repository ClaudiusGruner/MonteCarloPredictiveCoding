# Deep Latent Gaussian Models

A PyTorch implementation for Deep Latent Gaussian Models(DLGM), 
proposed by 
[Stochastic Backpropagation and Approximate Inference in Deep Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4082)

This implementation of DLGMs was obtained from [Yiyue Zhuo](https://github.com/yiyuezhuo/Deep-Latent-Gaussian-Models)
